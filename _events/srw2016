# Stream Reasoning Workshop 2016

The Stream Reasoning Workshop will take place from December 8th to 9th, 2016.


## Organisation

 * Manfred Hauswirth
 * Thomas Eiter
 * Fredrik Heintz
 * Minh Dao-Tran 
 * Danh Le-Phuoc

## Aim and scope

Processing, querying and reasoning over streaming data is studied in different communities such as KR&R, Semantic Web, Databases, Stream Processing, Complex Event Processing, etc., where researchers have different perspectives and face different challenges.

This workshop aims at advancing Stream Reasoning as research theme by bringing together these different views and goals. In addition to invited talks, the workshop will provide opportunities for all participants to engage in discussions on open problems and future directions.

Participation is by invitation only. Registration is free of charge and includes attendance to all workshop events and lectures, coffee breaks, and lunches.

## Date and venue

The workshop will be held on December 8-9, 2016

Title: Towards Declarative Stream Processing using Apache Flink 
Abstract: Apache Flink is an open source system for expressive, declarative, fast, and efficient data analysis on both batch and streaming data. Flink combines the scalability and programming flexibility of distributed MapReduce-like platforms with the efficiency, out-of-core execution, and query optimization capabilities found in parallel databases. At its core, Flink builds on a distributed dataflow runtime that unifies batch and incremental computations over a true-streaming, pipelined execution engine. Its programming model allows for stateful, fault tolerant computations, flexible user-defined windowing semantics for streaming and unique support for iterations. Flink is converging into a use-case complete system for parallel data processing with a wide range of top level libraries including machine learning and graph processing. Apache Flink originates from the Stratosphere project led by TU Berlin and incorporates the results of various scientific papers published in VLDBJ, SIGMOD, (P)VLDB, ICDE, HPDC, etc.

#### Coffee break: 10:00 - 10:30
